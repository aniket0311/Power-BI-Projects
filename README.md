# Unified Mentor Internship Projects:

1. Bird Crash Analysis Report : The Bird Crash Analysis project provides an interactive dashboard showcasing bird strike data on flights.
   Key metrics include 193 people injured, 334K birds struck, 101.01K bird-stricken flights, and $1 billion in total costs.
   Visualizations include a word cloud of incident remarks, pie charts for plane size and pilot warnings, bar charts for
   flight phase impact, and altitude of strikes. The project highlights that most bird strikes occur below 1000 feet,
   often involve medium-sized birds, and typically impact flights during approach or take-off. This analysis aids in
    understanding and mitigating bird strike incidents in aviation.
